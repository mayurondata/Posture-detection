Welcome to the Posture Detection project! Our project focuses on developing posture detection scripts for specific exercises, such as push-ups and dumbbell exercises. The goal is to leverage computer vision techniques to detect and analyze postures during these exercises, providing valuable insights to users to help them maintain proper form and reduce the risk of injuries during their workouts.

## Introduction

Maintaining correct posture while performing exercises is crucial for maximizing the benefits of workouts and preventing injuries. In this project, we employ computer vision to monitor users' movements and provide real-time feedback on their form. Our current focus is on detecting and analyzing postures during specific exercises.

## Features

- Real-time posture detection for push-ups and dumbbell exercises.
- Visual feedback to users about their posture during these exercises.
- Plans for future data logging and analysis for progress tracking.
- Adaptability for personalized feedback.
- Utilizes computer vision techniques.
- Minimalist script-based approach for posture detection.

## Usage

Our project currently consists of two posture detection scripts: one for push-ups and another for dumbbell exercises. Here's how to use them:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/posture-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd posture-detection`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Push-Up Detection

1. Run the push-up detection script: `python pushup_detection.py`
2. Position yourself in front of the camera.
3. Perform push-ups.
4. Receive real-time feedback on your push-up form.

### Dumbbell Detection

1. Run the dumbbell detection script: `python dumbbell_detection.py`
2. Position yourself in front of the camera with dumbbells.
3. Perform your dumbbell exercises.
4. Receive real-time feedback on your dumbbell exercise form.

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV for computer vision
- Machine learning models for pose estimation
